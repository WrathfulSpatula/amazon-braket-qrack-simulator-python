This is the first release of the Qrack Simulator for Amazon Braket SDK!

The (Amazon Braket SDK) Qrack Simulator is a Python open source library that provides an implementation of a quantum simulator that you can run locally. Qrack is a well-rounded simulator in development for over six years, with GPU acceleration and novel approaches to canonical algorithms. Both OpenCL and CUDA back ends are available (supporting general GPU and accelerator vendors through the open standard of OpenCL).
